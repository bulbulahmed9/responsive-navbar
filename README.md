# Responsive Navbar

This is a beginner project of mine, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for educational purposes. Itâ€™s a simple responsive navigation bar that works on both desktop and mobile screens. The project helped me practice building a basic navbar, making it responsive, and adding simple JavaScript interactivity like a toggle menu.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

To try it out, clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser.
